As travelling around the world is no longer a disturbing problem to most people nowadays, thanks to the convenience of transportation, it is ubiquitous for tourists to enjoy visiting other cities in their spare time. Generally speaking, there are numbers of ways to get familiar with a city in limited time, among which three of them are touring historic sites, going to markets or shops and eating in restaurants and spending time in cafes. Visitors can choose either of these ways depending on their own situations, but from my perspective, historic sites are the most significant parts of a city.

First, historic sites composes of the city memory, which witness the development or depression of the ever-changing city. If tourists want to know more about a city, how the city looks like currently is not everything they should be informed. Thinking of a city that is not the center in a country. I'd like to take Nanjing as a example, where I currently dwell in. It owns a glorious history once upon a time, outweighing all other cities in China. However, prosperity like before no longer exists in this city. Thus, that's why historic sites plays an exceedingly important role in presenting what a city had experienced, which is also the most helping method for tourists to get more familiar with the certain city.

Admittedly, food also accounts for a great part of the culture in regions. As a consequence, eating restaurants or spending time in cafes is a decent way to experience the folk culture of cities. The problem is that what tourist know by having food in fact. In limited time, they can hardly enjoy all the delicious food or snacks in a city. It is needless to mention that whether they can know the city better by barely putting food into their stomach. The point is how food reflects culture is not easy to understand by simply eating them. Instead, they should know more about it by reading historical materials.

For markets or shops, in my opinion, is the least effective way to know about a city. The reason is obvious that those kind of places is only a sign of financial development. In well-developed cities, shops are probably similar despite of country differences. For example, shops like Bandai Store, which is only located in Japan before, begin to open in Shanghai. As a matter of fact, stores can hardly present any distinct characteristics in cities.

In sum, although there are ways to know more about a city for tourists to choose, visiting historic sites is always the most effecive one.

With the ease of transportation nowadays, traveling to different parts of the world has become a common leisure activity for many. To explore a city in a limited time, tourists have various options, such as visiting historic sites, going to markets or shops, eating in restaurants, and spending time in cafes. While all of these ways have their merits, I believe that historic sites are the most significant parts of a city.

Historic sites provide a window into a city's past and the changes it has undergone over time. To truly understand a city, it is not enough to only see what it looks like now. Take Nanjing, the city I currently reside in, for example. It has a rich history and used to be one of the most prosperous cities in China. However, that glory is now a thing of the past. Therefore, historic sites play a crucial role in showcasing a city's journey, making them an essential part of a tourist's itinerary.

Food is undoubtedly an integral part of a city's culture, and eating in restaurants or cafes is a great way to experience local cuisine. However, merely trying out different foods may not be enough to fully understand a city's culture in a limited time. It is not easy to grasp the cultural significance of a dish by simply eating it. Instead, reading about the history and origin of the food can provide more insights into the city's culture.

Markets and shops, on the other hand, may not be the best way to explore a city. While they are indicative of a city's economic development, they may not provide much insight into the city's unique character. In many cases, shops in developed cities may even be

With the ease of modern transportation, traveling around the world has become a common pastime for many people. There are various ways to explore a city in a limited amount of time, such as visiting historic sites, checking out local markets or shops, and dining in restaurants or cafes. However, in my opinion, historic sites are the most significant parts of a city.

Historic sites are not just mere attractions, but they also serve as a city's memory. They bear witness to the city's development and changes over time. Understanding a city's history is crucial to truly getting to know it. For example, Nanjing, the city where I currently reside, has a glorious past, surpassing many other cities in China. However, the city has also faced setbacks, and understanding its history is key to appreciating its present state. Therefore, visiting historic sites is the most helpful method for tourists to learn about a city.

While food is an important part of a city's culture, it can be difficult to fully experience it in a limited amount of time. It's not enough to simply eat local cuisine; tourists need to delve deeper into the history and cultural significance of the food. While dining in local restaurants or cafes can provide some insight, it may not be the most effective way to understand a city's culture.

Exploring markets or shops can also be informative, but it may not be the best way to get to know a city. Shops and markets may not offer much insight into a city's unique characteristics, particularly in well-developed cities where shops may be similar regardless of their location.

In conclusion, while there are many ways to explore a city, visiting historic sites is the most effective way to truly understand its past, present, and future.

Both the reading and listening are talking about a new job: buzzers, but the speaker, a student who takes buzzer as his part-time job, disagrees the perspective made in the reading in several aspects.

The critics in the reading first claim that as people are not sure whether other ones are buzzers, they are prone to get misleading information about the product. However, the student is strongly against this because in fact, they are not ordinary advertisement. The company choose them for they actually think the product is good. Thus, people who talk to them can get truth about the product.

Furthermore, the reading suggests that people are not as suspicious to products recommanded by buzzers as they are to other adcertisment. In  contrary, the student reckons that they are suspicious enough because they often ask him a lot about the product, such as the price, service, as well as the time he uses it. 

Finally, it is acclaimed in the reading that buzzing possibly do harm to social relationships while the student thinks that it is ridiculous. As a matter of fact, people tend to enjoy the products recommanded by buzzers for they are sincere. Thus, buzzers in fact become more trustful for those people.


老师 上了课我觉得我下午问的问题有点不够清楚。老师说的例子是选择控制饮食来减肥，但这里的减肥就是文章题目里的直接目的，也就是已经是逻辑链的最后一环，自然不用再说减肥以后怎么样。

但是我说的是这种情况：是否同意小朋友多参加 team sports

我的其中一个同意的原因是 team sports 可以促进 cooperation。那么我认为说 cooperation 有助于小朋友的成长用以说明我同意 team sports，是一个合理的逻辑。

然后带入 city 的那个问题，那么我选择 historical sites，因为记载了城市历史，而城市历史是城市的重要一部分，它可以帮助我们更好地了解（现在的）城市。这个逻辑应该不能算错？

不知道这样是否 make sense
