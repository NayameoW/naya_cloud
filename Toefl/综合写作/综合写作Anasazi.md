Both the reading and lecture focus on the problem why Anasazi suddenly disappeared. The reading mainly attribute the disapperance to wars, but the professor believes that shortage of water is the major factor.

Firstly, the author claims that Anasazi was defeated by American tribes so that their ritual sites were burned. However, the professor believes that the sites were actually burned by Anasazi themselves. He suggests that Anasazi held ceremonies in which they burned their ritual sites to ask the God for more water.

Furthermore, the reading suggests that a lot of personal belongings of individual Anasazi was unearthed, which means they might got killed or ran away because of sudden wars. On the contrary, the professor thinks that this is also an evidence that they were in water shortage. Because they had no water and attempted to search for water sources, they moved to other places without taking useless articles with them. 

Finally, the author said Anasazi was invaded by other tribes for their settlement were located in good places with rich water resourses. But the professor points out that the population increased to ten times of its previous number during a Golden time. Meanwhile, the rain fell less frequently. As a result, the water resource could not satisfy the need of such a large population. So the Anasazi Indians gradually disappear.

(Due to a lack of water, they had to search for new sources and left behind non-essential items as they moved to other locations)
