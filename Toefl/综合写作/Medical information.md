Both the passage and the lecture are based on medical information. The passage states that electronic medical record systems have several advantages but the professor holds a totally different opinion.

> The reading believes it offers many advantages, yet the lecture casts doubt on every single point the reading makes.

Firstly, the author claims that electronic records contribute to reduce costs on storing and transferring medical records. But the professor points out that these costs are actually not very significant. Moreover, using electronic records cannot save money in storage at all because even those doctors who use electronic records will keep the paper records as backup.

> Since many doctors still keep paper records as a backup or for legal reasons even if they use electronic systems, the costs for paper records storage still cannot be avoided.

Furthermore, the passage suggests that fewer mistakes will be made if electronic records are used, because of the standardization of forms and readable computer fonts. On the contrary, the professor thinks that paper records serve as notes for doctors. Also, it is a staff's job to interprete paper records into electronic ones. Errors are still likely to be made if the staff cannot understand the doctor's poor writing.

Finally, the author states that electronic records can provide medical research with great amount of data. However, the professor claims that although the records are electronic, researchers still have to face the strict privacy laws. As most of the data are not granted, it is still difficult for them to collect medical data from databases.
